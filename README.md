# Machine Learning Operations - Hands-on workshop

In the workshop, we take a simple machine learning project from a Jupyter Notebook
into an automated ML training pipeline. We start by adding experiment tracking to the
notebook using MLflow. Then, we refactor the project into a pipeline of data assets
using dagster.

* [Step 1: Experiment tracking](step-1-experiment-tracking.md)
* [Step 2: Data orchestration](step-2-orchestration.md)
* [Step 3: IO management](step-3-io-management.md)
* [Step 4: Configuration](step-4-configuration.md)
* [Step 5: Automation and scheduling](step-5-automation.md)

This repository provides the code skeleton that will be used to implement the project.
